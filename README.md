# Homework_02

## Description:

    I was tasked with the objective to take a working Webpage, HTML and CSS files included, and make it sure that it meets accessibility standards.

    I didn't add pictures that weren't already in the downloaded folder. I did go above and beyond on the Navigation Bar. 
    
    I made sure that no matter the size of the browser, the content inside the main sections stayed in their areas.

    I researched the Accessibilty Standards and made sure that every image had an alt attribute. I also made sure that when anyone views the source code, they find semantic HTML elements. This was mainly done with using more dexriptive tags such as <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <section>, <main> and <aside> instead of having all <div> tags.

## Installation:
    No installation needed

## Usage:
    I recommend comparing this with the original code to truly see the difference in a Webpage that follows the Accessibilty Standards and one that doesn't.
## Contributing:
    The following are the instructions that I was given:

    GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
    
    WHEN I view the source code
    THEN I find semantic HTML elements
    
    WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
    THEN I find that the elements follow a logical
    structure independent of styling and positioning
    
    WHEN I view the image elements
    THEN I find accessible alt attributes
    
    WHEN I view the heading attributes
    THEN they fall in sequential order
    
    WHEN I view the title element
    THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

    These instructions were given from the Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp from the University and Trilogy.
